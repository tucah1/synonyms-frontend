# Reeinvent Synonyms Project
## Project Frontend Documentation
Frontend for this project is developed using React.js and it consists of a single page web application. On this web application, users can add new synonyms to the system and search synonyms for existing words in the system.

Synonyms search is implemented to work as a real time search which provides results as user is typing into the search bar.

Synonyms are added to the application by providing a word and a list of synonyms of that word. List of synonyms is expected to be entered as a comma separated list.
For example:
```
word: word1
list of synonyms: word2, word3, word4
```

All project requirements are implemented, including the bonus requirements. Solution is deployed online with backend and frontend accessible on following URLs:
